# GROOT
GROOT is an irrigation system that aims to improve the life of plants

Our system uses web scraping techniques in order to get the appropriate information about every single plant.
Using these information, we can control the main water pump and the valve for each set of identical plants to water the plants based on their soil moisture level that is being calculated by the soil moisture sensor.
Moreover, GROOT  can calculate the water consumption of each plant during a specific period of time.
A website is also available for data visualization of the soil moisture level and water consumption.
All of this is controlled using a Raspberry Pi 3.

In the files, you will find main1.py and in groot_website you will find main2.py
The username and password of the database have been changed for security purposes, please make sure to change them in main2.py and Database.py before running the programs.
If you need to generate random graphs for demonstration purposes, you can use RandomValues.py located in groot_website (Don't forget to change the username and password)

HAPPY CODING! and PLANTING!
